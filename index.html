                    <em class="detail">2015-present</em>
                    <p class="description">The goal of this study is to provide recommendations
                      for the design of informational resources to bridge the gap between Theory and Design.
                      Academic research provides important insights for product design, however, past work shows
                      that academic findings are rarely applied in industry. I interviewed 18 design practitioners
                      to identify what informational resources they use in their work and how these support their
                      workflow. I prompted participants with design challenges, producing 18 outcomes which I
                      compared to the interviews. Now, I am designing a website to assist designer's workflow
                      based on my study's findings. It will work as a search engine to find solutions to specific
                      design problems. The next step is conducting in-context usability tests of the tool.</p>

                    <em class="detail">2014-2015</em>
                    <p class="description">This study provides design implications for helping designers
                      create social comparisons that motivate higher game performance. Designers often
                      make use of social comparisons to motivate people to perform better. I created two
                      different feedbacks based on the concept of closeness to comparison. Specifically,
                      I tested (1) comparing users to a target described as a similarly experienced player,
                      and (2) adjusting the visual representation of performance so player scores appear closer
                      to the comparison target. We evaluate the effects of these strategies for social comparison
                      on player performance in a controlled experiment with 425 participants, followed by a survey.
                      Both feedback techniques improved game performance,
                      but only for experienced players. <a href="./pdf/closeness_chi2016.pdf">Read the note</a>.</p>

                    <em class="detail">2015</em>
                    <p class="description">Non-profit organizations operate with limited or infrequent
                      funding and personnel. As these organizations encounter increasing demand for their services,
                      they face constraints that require them to creatively adapt their work practices in the short
                      term, through forms of contingent action. In the long term, it is necessary for organizations
                      to adapt and re-articulate their practices. Our research team conducted fieldwork in the West
                      Seattle Tool Library (WSTL) from April to June 2015. A tool library functions much like a
                      traditional book library, lending out tools and equipment to patrons. We asked, “How does
                      the core team of the WSTL manage its inventory, labor and finances in the face of increasing
                      demand?” Our findings surfaced the strategies used by a small non-profit as it responds to
                      membership growth and increasing demand on its resources.

                    <em class="detail">2014</em>
                    <p class="description">We identified low engagement in the email campaign builder when
                      I worked for <a href="http://resultadosdigitais.com.br/">Resultados Digitais</a>.
                      A first set of potential issues were identified in-house through a participatory design
                      session with customer relationship managers. Their insights informed the creation of an
                      interview protocol around client's practices for email campaign creation. After talking
                      with 6 of our customers, I identified a set of opportunities to increase Trust in the use
                      of our tool. Supported by this qualitative data, I designed a prototype, used to inquire
                      clients in a follow-up conversation, which informed a second iteration. The resulting prototype
                      serves as a reference for future versions of the email feature.</p>
