Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/">Human Centered Design and Engineering</a> at the University of Washington, where I teach HCI and Design to undergrad and graduate students. I am advised by <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/garyhs/">Gary Hsieh</a> and <a href="http://www.smunson.com/">Sean Munson</a>.
              Before grad school I worked in industry for 7 years — read my resume <a href="./pdf/resume.pdf">here</a>. <br/>

                  <p class="description">As a UX Researcher Intern in the Growth & Solutions team, I worked closely with researchers, designers, developers and PMs to identify opportunities for research, design and conduct studies, and analyze and present results. Specifically, I was responsible for a) conducting user research on Ads products and experiences; b) collecting and analyzing user behavior data through semi-formal interviews and concept testing; c) working cross-functionally with Design, Product Management, and Engineering to incorporate user-centered research at all stages of the product cycle; d) proactively designing studies intended to understand advertiser practices and needs.</p>

                    <p class="description">The goal of this study is to bridge the Research and Practice gap in HCI. Academic Research provides important insights for Product Design, however, academic findings are rarely applied in industry. I interviewed 22 design practitioners to identify what informational resources they use in their work and how these support their workflow. The next step is designing an interface where designers and researchers can collaborate and share information.</p>

                    <p class="description">This study provides design implications for designing social comparisons that motivate higher performance among gamers. Specifically, we tested two designs: a) comparing users to a target described as a similarly experienced player, and b) adjusting the visual representation of performance so player scores appear closer to the comparison target. We evaluated the effects of these strategies in a controlled experiment with 425 participants. Both feedback techniques improved experienced gamers performance. <a href="./pdf/closeness_chi2016.pdf">Read the report</a> for findings and recommendations.</p>

                    <p class="description">Non-profit organizations operate with limited or infrequent funding and personnel. Facing  membership growth and increasing demand on its services, small non-profits are required to creatively adapt their work practices re-articulate their process. Our research team conducted fieldwork in the West Seattle Tool Library (WSTL) from April to June 2015. A tool library functions much like a traditional book library, lending out tools and equipment to patrons. We asked, “How does the core team of the WSTL manage its inventory, labor and finances in the face of increasing demand?”

                      A first set of potential issues were identified in-house through preliminary interviews with Customer Success Managers. Based on the issues, I created an interview protocol about client's practices for planning, creating, and firing email campaigns. After talking
                      with 6 of our customers, I identified opportunities to increase <i>trust</i> in the use of our tool. Supported by this qualitative data, I designed a prototype, used to inquire
                      clients in a follow-up conversation, which informed a second iteration.</p>
