                    Behavior Change Design Sprints, why and how-to
  UX and interaction designers often create products and services to help people give up on bad habits or to perform positive behaviors such as exercising more or eating healthy. This process of creating technologies to nudge or change behavior is known behavior change design.

  There are some processes for designing behavior change technologies such as the Persuasive by Design Behavior Change model, The Behavior Change process, which is very similar to the User-Centered Design process. And there’s the work of Fogg which is one of the most prominent in this field.




  Essen, Hermsen, Renes
  Persuasive by Design Behavior Change Model
  Wendel
  Behavior change process
  Fogg
  Behavior Wizard

  I identified a few downsides in these processes to design behavior change technologies. I took these downsides and used them as design goals for the creation of a new behavior design process.

  Workflow fit. past behavior change design processes don’t properly adapt to the context of designers. Processes are either too time-consuming or use terminology that is unusual for designers. Therefore, Fits into designers’ workflow, a process that is fast and has more familiar terminology and exercises

  Theory-driven insights. past processes are also disconnected from behavior change literature. They don’t offer clear guidance on how to incorporate behavior change theory into the design process. I want to facilitate the use and application of behavior change theory - there’s a wealth of behavior change theories that can be leveraged in this space

  Design ethics. Past processes don’t have any particular steps or guidance related to design ethics. As we all know, ethics is a particularly challenging aspect of behavior change design. I want to encourage designers to consider ethics as a key factor in the design behavior change technologies.
  The Behavior Change Design Sprint - how does it work?
  Instead of creating a process from scratch, and to better align to what designers do in practice
  We took the Google Design Sprint process as a foundation for our process. It is a pretty straightforward step by step, with terminology and exercises that are familiar to designers.

  Preparation
  This is how the sessions worked. We split the participants in groups of 3 or 4, They had materials such as whiteboard, post its, markers. And the whole sprint happened in less than 90 minutes  so it’s a rapid design workshop, because we wanted it to fit into a realistic time slot that design teams could use for a session



  To start with the sprint one needs a challenge. This is a problem-based process. But having a clear goal and having a design scenario are the most important inputs for the sprint.
  We also used personas and scenarios.
  The example shows a design challenge that we used in our assessment
  which is about encouraging people to Buy Healthier Food.


  Map
  In the first step, participants are asked to read and become familiar with the input materials. In our case the design challenges, personas, and design scenarios. In the user journey exercise, we wanted participants to visualize the design scenarios through the use of a diagram showing a sequence of events that a persona goes through.

  Participants use whiteboards to draw out the user journey, which facilitates group work by creating this shared resource that they can use throughout the sprint. It is also an opportunity to clearly map out the target behavior, which we ask participants to do with a different color marker -- In this example, taking the stairs instead of taking the elevator


  Target behavior
  Current behavior


  The user journey exercise helps participants to design interventions with a focus on a particular behavior outcome. By being able to visualize the design scenario which is usually presented as a text paragraph, and highlight the target behavior, it allows participants to use the journey as a framework to drive discussions and decisions. It kept reminding participants of what is really important, keeping them on track to design for a specific behavior outcome and tackle the design challenge

  The user journey also helped participants to identify specific times and location for their design interventions. They clearly defined and agreed as a group in what context their interventions would come into play. The exercise helped participants to pinpoint the Exact moment when people make a decision

  One important thing that the user journey exercise has to do. Participants need to think about the why of behaviors. Identify obstacles for target behaviors to happen and then quickly jumped to the ideation of interventions. We really want participants to think through why this persona is only buying unhealthy foods rather than healthy foods And Why are they are having fights at home over their familiy’s diet?

  Sketch
  In the second step we expose participants to behavior change theories. We suggest incorporating behavior change theory into the sprint with design cards. The cards we used are based on the list of theories below. However, we believe that other resources could be used, for example Lockton’s cognitive biases cards, or even  insights  from user research. What is important here is that cards should have clear recommendations that can help designers brainstorm ways to address their design challenge.


  Transtheoretical Model
  Theory of Planned Behavior
  Health Belief Model
  Social Cognitive Theory
  Incentives and Rewards
  Self-Determination Theory
  Goal-setting

  We found that the theory cards were used by participants as talking points and sparked interesting conversations of how to influence behaviors. This was key because without the cards, brainstorming often generates more general ideas such as how to make designs easier to use or more delightful.

  The linking exercise is where participants link recommendations from the cards into the user journey



  Here participants would tape cards over the user journeys on the whiteboard.
  After that, participants were prompted to brainstorm possible design interventions as a group using the journey and the cards


  Then, individually, participants were prompted to sketch ideas based on the brainstorming and the behavior change cards
  In this step we provided prompts related to behavior change design such as:
  Design an intervention to increase the benefits of taking an action
  Could someone else help the persona engage in behavior change? How?

  Sketching, it was difficult to incorporate theory in sketching. We are not quite sure of how to do that. As I said before, we created behavior change related prompts for sketching

  But sketching is by nature a more open-ended activity and We are not sure if our approach was wrong or if this just the way sketching works!

  Decide
  In the third step, participants are asked to present their ideas to their peers.
  Groups use a checklist to have conversations about
  the use of theory, and also the ethics of their ideas.
   At the end of this step, groups converge on one idea to do the prototyping step.

  We learned that deciding which idea to pursue as a team is an ongoing negotiation, not an event that happens only after brainstorming and sketching.
  Participants constantly aligned their views of how the design challenge could be solved since the first step
  So we think that there’s an opportunity  here to facilitate discussions throughout the sprint

  Prototyping
  Which happens here in the last step.
  Here participants are asked to create low-fidelity prototypes
  And in parallel to prototyping, participants are asked to annotate their designs - which we called advocacy. Here groups are prompted to clearly explain how the behavior change theories were used to inspire their prototypes, and discuss the ethics of their designs

  Last step, we learned that behavior change theories facilitated the annotation exercises
  Participants explained their design rationale by using the cards and incorporated some of the arguments present in the cards in their annotations. This facilitated  explaining how their proposed design interventions worked

  Ethics
  But one thing that we were really not happy with is that design ethics discussions were shallow and didn’t affect the proposed designs as much as we wanted
  Annotations were limited to saying that designs had ethical limitations, and that more work would be required to address and understand the issues

  This problem is invites us to think more deeply about how ethics could be better integrated throughout the design process and
  We’ve been altering the sprint to make ethics a more central part of the process
