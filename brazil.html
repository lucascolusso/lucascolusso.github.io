      <h4>Brazilian folk art apps</h4>

          <p class="intro">

          </p>
          <p>
            I was tasked to create a series of Flash apps for Brazilian folk art festival.
            I was resposible for the design, illustrations, and coding of every app.
            See some of the apps I designed in the videos below!

          <p>
            Adobe Flash wasn't the perfect design tool. However, as a designer,
            it was great to have full control of the concept, design, and implementation
            of an experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            This end-to-end project pipeline tying design and coding together
            taught me early on my design career the importance of learning programming languages.
            After ActionScript (the programming language used to code Flash apps),
            I learned the basics of PHP, RoR, Python, and Javascript,
            as well as HTML and CSS.

          <h6>Sound car voting</h6>
          <p>
            Sound cars are wheel-mounted makeshift speakers,
            and are common in certain regions of Brazil.
            Informal workers walk or drive their sound cards around town
            to advertise a mix of new music or deals from local stores.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app I designed lets viewers vote for their favorite songs.
            Festival organizers selected a list of songs that represent many different
            types of Brazilian folk music, from classic to rap, celebrating my country's
            cultural diversity.

          <h6>The cultural movements tree quiz</h6>
          <p>
            This app works as a quiz where users need to match the names
            of artists with the cultural movements they belonged to.
            For example, Tarsila do Amaral was a famous Modernist painter in Brazil.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users can drag each leaves to the tree's branches,
            trying to match artists to right cultural movement.
            If all matches are correct, then users have the chance to look
            at each painters' works of art.
            If not, the wind will blow and take the wrong leaves back onto the ground,
            and users have another try at the quiz.
          </p>

          <h6>Puzzles of paintings by Brazilian women artists</h6>
          <p>
            This app is essentially a collection of puzzles.
            Each puzzle uses a famous painting made by prominent
            Brazilian artists. The app was particularly focused on
            showcasing the variety of styles and richness of
            paintings made by women.
          </p>
          <p>
            After putting the pieces of each puzzle together,
            users can check out more paintings by the artist they chose.
