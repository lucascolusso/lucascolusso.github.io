            <p class="first">From time to time I manage to design apps and other artefacts, amid the chaos of my Ph.D. studies.
              I'm a designer and a design researcher, doing my
              Ph.D. in <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/">HCDE</a> at the University of Washington/Seattle, advised by <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/garyhs/">Gary Hsieh</a> and <a href="http://www.smunson.com/">Sean Munson</a>.
              I conduct my research as a member of the Prosocial Computing Lab and I teach HCI and Design to Bachelor and Master's students.
              Prior to the Ph.D., I worked in industry for 5 years, read my full CV <a href="./pdf/colusso_cv.pdf">here</a>.

                    <p class="description">The goal of this study is to provide recommendations
                      for the design of informational resources to bridge the gap between Theory and Design.
                      Academic research provides important insights for product design, however, past work shows
                      that academic findings are rarely applied in industry. I interviewed 18 design practitioners
                      to identify what informational resources they use in their work and how these support their
                      workflow. I prompted participants with design challenges, producing 18 outcomes which I
                      compared to the interviews. Now, I am designing a website to assist designer's workflow
                      based on my study's findings. It will work as a search engine to find solutions to specific
                      design problems. The next step is conducting in-context usability tests of the tool.</p>

                    <p class="description">This study provides design implications for helping designers
                      create social comparisons that motivate higher game performance. Designers often
                      make use of social comparisons to motivate people to perform better. I created two
                      different feedbacks based on the concept of closeness to comparison. Specifically,
                      I tested (1) comparing users to a target described as a similarly experienced player,
                      and (2) adjusting the visual representation of performance so player scores appear closer
                      to the comparison target. We evaluate the effects of these strategies for social comparison
                      on player performance in a controlled experiment with 425 participants, followed by a survey.
                      Both feedback techniques improved game performance,
                      but only for experienced players. <a href="./pdf/closeness_chi2016.pdf">Read the note</a>.</p>
